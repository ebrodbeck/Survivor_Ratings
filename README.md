Distribution of season rating broken down by race, gender, and age. Seasons won by white and black winners rate about the same, Asian and Hispanic winners like Yul, Natalie, and Sandra elevate their respective ratings, especially due to the small sample size in these demographics. The bottom right plot does not have a distribution for some demographics because there was only 1 winner in that group.
